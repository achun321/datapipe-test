# Using DataPipe with jsPsych

*This guide assumes that you are already familiar with jsPsych and that you have already followed the [getting started guide](https://pipe.jspsych.org/getting-started) on DataPipe to setup an experiment.*

### Load the jsPsychPipe plugin

The jsPsychPipe plugin is available via [jspsych-contrib](https://github.com/jspsych/jspsych-contrib/tree/main/packages/plugin-pipe).

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@jspsych-contrib/plugin-pipe">
```

### Add a jsPsychPipe trial

To save all of the data generated by jsPsych, add a `jsPsychPipe` trial at the end of your experiment. Replace the `experiment_id` with the ID provided by DataPipe.

```js
const save_data = {
  type: jsPsychPipe,
  action: "save",
  experiment_id: "ABCDEF123456",
  filename: filename,
  data_string: ()=>jsPsych.data.get().csv()
};
```

Note that you will need to generate a unique `filename`. One way to do this is:

```js
const filename = `${jsPsych.randomization.randomID(10)}-data.csv`
